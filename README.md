# virtual-book-shelf

## Project Overview
Have you ever wanted to keep track of the books you have read and give each book a rating?

This concept isn't new, and many companies have built platforms for this very purpose, such as LibraryThing.

### What I Built
In this project, I created my own virtual bookshelf using Flask and SQLite. The application includes the following features:

Database Setup: An SQLite database to store book information and ratings.
CRUD Operations: Functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete entries in the database.
Flask Integration: A Flask application to interact with the database and serve data to the user.
### How It Works
Add Books: Users can add new books to their bookshelf, including details such as title, author, and rating.
View Books: Users can view a list of all books in their collection.
Update Books: Users can update information and ratings for existing books.
Delete Books: Users can remove books from their collection.
By following this project, I learned how to manage a database and integrate it with a web application. This virtual bookshelf is a functional tool to keep track of and rate books I've read.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the code and functionality in action!
